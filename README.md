### **Heart Disease Risk Assessment Project**

This repository contains code for a heart disease risk assessment project, allowing users to input health metrics through a user-friendly interface and implementing a machine learning model (Random Forest) for risk assessment.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains anonymized patient data related to heart disease diagnosis. It includes features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle via the following link: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

### **Project Overview**

The project involves the following steps:

1. **User Interface Development:** Creating a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to allow users to input their health metrics conveniently.
2. **Model Building:** Constructing a machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to predict the risk of heart disease based on the input health metrics.
3. **Model Deployment:** Deploying the model within the Streamlit application to provide real-time risk assessment.

### **Files**

- **`heart_disease_risk_assessment.py`**: Python script containing the code for the user interface, model building, and deployment.
- **`heart_disease_dataset.csv`**: CSV file containing the heart disease patient data.

### **Usage**

To use the code in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the **`heart_disease_dataset.csv`** file from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the repository directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    
    ```
    Copy code
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```
    
4. Run the **`heart_disease_risk_assessment.py`** script to execute the project code.
